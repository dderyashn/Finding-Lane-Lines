Self Driving Car: Finding Lane Lines with Python and OpenCV
It’s amazing to see how future is getting closer to us everyday. We see and use things that we used to see only in the movies and only dream about these on our daily life now, like self driving cars. They’re one of the most marvelous and fascinating creations in engineering. I think, borning of more and more fascinating works about cars as knowledge and interest in self-driving cars increase is so exciting for the future. Who knows? Maybe we're already in the future we've been waiting for.
If you have interest in self driving cars and you’re new at deep learning, this article can help you to start finding lane lines using Computer Vision techniques in Python.
